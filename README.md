## âš  Quick note

As you can see, at the moment code is pretty messy somewhere, GitHub Actions are set up wrong, and I'm making unclear commits directly into main branch. I just need some time to figure out how to organize this project :)

## About

Mono is an open source multipurpose Discord bot coded with warmth and love in Typescript using [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).

## Discord.js Fork

I use fork of Discord.js to return extendable structures, which [were removed in v13](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/pull/6027). The structure problems mentioned in the issue do not apply to Mono. On the contrary, structs help keep code clean and comfortable.
